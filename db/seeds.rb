# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

    # 20.times do |id|
    #     BodyWeightHeight.create!(
    #         user_id: Faker::Number.between(from: 1, to: 4),
    #         weight: Faker::Number.decimal(l_digits: 2),
    #         height: Faker::Number.decimal(l_digits: 2),
    #         note: Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 3),
    #         bmi_calculation: Faker::Number.decimal(l_digits: 2),
    #         date_time: "2022-06-22 13:50:19"
